Task 1. Write a TCP server program: which passively listens for an incoming TCP connection.

A. Write a TCP client program: which actively opens a TCP connection to the server.

B. On connection establishment, the server should print the IP address and port of the client's end of the TCP connection.

C. After connection establishment, the server application should send 1500 bytes periodically, every SEND_INTERVAL milliseconds.
• What this means is: if the time since the previous send is less than SEND_INTERVAL, then make the process sleep (using usleep) for the appropriate amount of time.

D. After connection establishment, the client application should receive 1500 bytes periodically, every RECEIVE_INTERVAL milliseconds.
• What this means is: if the time since the previous receive is less than the RECEIVE_INTERVAL, then make the process sleep for the appropriate amount of time.
