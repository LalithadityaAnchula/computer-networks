Task: Implementation of subnetting and supernetting concepts.

Expecting Output:
Scenario 1. Generate forwarding table with following details
a. Number of subnets
b. Subnet mask
c. Broadcast address (Target)
d. Number of hosts per subnet
e. First Host ID
f. Last Host ID
g. Subnet address

Scenario 2. The system should be intelligent enough to understand the given inputs and display
the suitable class type (may use subnet or supernet) with highest throughput

Example 1. An organization has 30 different physical networks; each network has about 2000
hosts. How many classes would be required and what type of class.
Inputs: number of physical networks and number of hosts.
Outputs: class type, number of subnets, forwarding table, and throughput

Example 2. An organization has a physical network with 4000 hosts. How many classes would
be required and what type of class.
Inputs: number of hosts.
Outputs: class type, number of classes, address, and throughput
